# Scrap Classifier - Real-Time Scrap Detection App

This project is an **AI-powered real-time scrap classification system** that uses computer vision to detect and classify scrap materials such as plastic, iron, books, motors, cardboard, and non-recyclable waste using a webcam feed.

##  Project Features

- Real-time scrap detection using OpenCV
- Deep Learning model (YOLOv8 / MobileNetV2-based classifier)
- Scrap categories: `plastic`, `iron`, `books`, `cardboard`, `motors`, `non_recyclable`
- Webcam feed integration
- Trained on a custom labeled dataset
- Streamlit frontend for easy interaction (in development)

## Tech Stack

- Python 
- OpenCV 
- TensorFlow / Keras 
- YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
- Streamlit (Web App UI)
- Git & GitHub for version control
